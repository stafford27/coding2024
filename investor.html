    <p>Being an real estate investor can be risky depending on which route you go. There are a couple of different ways
        you could do this. The first
        would be to just buy properties with your own money and do what you can to make more money than you bought them
        for. The other way is to put money
        in with a big investor an multi family homes. Let's say you give them $100,000 to help them purchase the homes
        and they give you a % that is earned in return.
