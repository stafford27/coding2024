    <p>Wholesalling is the easiest type of real estate to get into as far as investment goes. This doesn't require a
        license in most states.
        The reason behind this is that you are just assigning contracts and not actually buying the properties. You get
        a
        home under contract and you
        sale it to an investor looking to buy it for cash. This also actaully helps families out. If someone has a home
        and
        they can't sale it due to
        it needing repairs this is their way around it. An wholesaler will sign a contract and find someone who wants to
        flip the house and pay cash which means
        they do not need to do the rapirs any longer. The reasons repairs are needed before sale is because banks wont
        take
        on the loan unless the house is in a certain condition.</p><br>
