    <p class="red">Almost everyone that first gets into real estate gets their license first. It's a great way to get knowledge in
        the field before you start taking risks.
        If you work hard the pay is well and you have a flexible schedule. It's usually 100% comission so it does
        require work if you want to get paid at all.
        The License takes 4-6 months to get typically.
